# Makers Academy week 3: Intro to the Web

## Introduction to the web, including:

* Servers and Clients
* HTTP requests and responses
* params
* sessions
* Web frameworks
* Feature testing with Capybara

## Setup

This project was completed using TDD and pairing. The daily changing pair programming nature of Maker's means that the project code base can change on a daily basis. Therefore, there are seperate (often ophan) branches for each session and these have not been merged due to differences in approach. 


## At a high level, this introduction involves:

Some basic exercises to get you familiar with Requests, Responses, and HTTP
A basic project to get you familiar with Servers, params, sessions
Some basic exercises to get you familiar with Capybara
An extended project to wrap it all together and build on previous weeks.
